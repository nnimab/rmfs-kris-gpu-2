**標題 (Title):** Dynamics between warehouse operations and vehicle routing

**摘要 (Abstract):**
When scheduling the distribution of ordered items from a warehouse to customers, the transportation planning is generally done first and serves as input for planning warehouse operations. Such a sequential approach can lead to substantial inefficiencies when the customer deliveries are restricted by time windows, and the warehouse has limited resources available (both order pickers and space in the staging area). This paper studies the trade-offs between warehouse operations and transportation planning. The goal is to understand the impact of three specific managerial interventions: adopting an integrated planning approach, expanding the available staging space, and expanding the delivery time windows. To this end, we propose a mathematical model for a general vehicle routing problem that incorporates order batching, order picker scheduling, staging, and vehicle loading. We introduce a novel idea to express the picking time of an order batch as a function of the batch size and develop a metaheuristic to solve this integrated problem. Furthermore, we develop exact algorithms to provide optimal solutions for the individual warehouse and transportation problems in a sequential planning approach. Managerial insights are distilled from case studies in two warehouses, one for ambient products and the other for refrigerated products, of a leading grocery retailer in the Netherlands. Our results show that integrated planning outperforms the other managerial interventions and generates cost savings between 9% and 11%. Savings are generally realized by executing larger order batch sizes to be picked in the warehouses at the expense of additional routing cost (around 2–3%). The second intervention in the form of time window expansions of only 15 minutes for customer deliveries can lead to cost savings between 4% and 6%, which results from a reduction in both transportation and warehousing cost. Expanding the capacity of the staging area is only meaningful when the staging space is highly utilized and only results in cost savings for the warehouse operations.

**標題 (Title):** Formulating and solving integrated order batching and routing in multi-depot AGV-assisted mixed-shelves warehouses
**作者 (Authors):** Lin Xie, Hanyi Li, Laurin Luttmann
**年份 (Year):** 2022
**摘要 (Abstract):**
Different retail and e-commerce companies are facing the challenge of assembling large numbers of time-critical picking orders that include both small-line and multi-line orders. To reduce unproductive picker working time as in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves storage policy, items of the same stock keeping unit are spread over several shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of human pickers. This is the first paper to combine both solutions, creating what we call AGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems. We model the new integrated order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual storage policy in AGV-assisted mixed-shelves systems for orders with different sizes of order lines (saving up to 62% on driving distances for AGVs). Our variable neighborhood search algorithm provides optimal solutions within an acceptable computational time.

**標題 (Title):** Planning and control of autonomous mobile robots for intralogistics: Literature review and research agenda
**作者 (Authors):** Giuseppe Fragapane, René de Koster, Fabio Sgarbossa, Jan Ola Strandhagen
**年份 (Year):** 2021
**摘要 (Abstract):**
Autonomous mobile robots (AMR) are currently being introduced in many intralogistics operations, like manufacturing, warehousing, cross-docks, terminals, and hospitals. Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within this field.

**標題 (Title):** Towards energy-efficient Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System: Hybrid agent-based simulation with DEA-based surrogate machine learning
**作者 (Authors):** Zakka Ugih Rizqi, Shuo-Yan Chou, Adi Dharma Oscar

**摘要 (Abstract):**
The rapid growth of retail e-commerce has increased demand for warehouses to handle large volumes and diverse SKUs. To meet these demands, Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is widely adopted. However, the automation in RMFS significantly raises energy consumption. The challenge is that the dynamic complexity of RMFS operations poses a major challenge in improving energy efficiency. This research proposes a hybrid optimization model to optimize traffic policy, routing strategy, number of robots, and robot’s max speed for reducing energy consumption while maintaining throughput rate. We first formulated a realistic RMFS energy consumption. A new priority rule for traffic policy was then proposed to reduce unnecessary stoppages. Two routing strategies namely Aisles Only and Underneath Pod were evaluated. Agent-based model was finally developed. Simulation experiment shows that the proposed priority rule reduces energy consumption by 3.41 % and increases the throughput by 26.07 % compared to FCFS. Further, global optimization was performed by first unifying conflicting objectives into a single-efficiency objective using Data Envelopment Analysis. Surrogate-based machine learning was then fitted and optimized via metaheuristic algorithm. The near-optimal configuration for RMFS was achieved by implementing the Priority Rule as traffic policy, Underneath Pod as routing strategy, 26 as number of robots, and 1.372 m/s as max speed. ANOVA reveals that the number of robots is the most influential factors to overall RMFS performance.
